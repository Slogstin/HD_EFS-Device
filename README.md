# Description
This Addon adds tiny scanner to [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor), which tells you exactly how much energy and fluid you have.
Useful if you play with starvation enabled and aren't using a custom HUD that already shows you those stats.

REQUIRES [UGLY AS SIN](https://github.com/caligari87/Ugly-as-Sin)!

    "We know how hard it can be to know exactly when you may need to hydrate.
    This is exactly why we started production of these handsome, little things!
    It's lightweight, small and you can clip it to your belt, so it barely takes
    any pocket space from your more important things, like your 20 ZM mags!
    It's easy to use too! Just fire it up and it'll show you the results. You
    don't even have to take your armour off, it'll always be accurate!"
